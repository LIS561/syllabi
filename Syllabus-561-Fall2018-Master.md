Course Description {#course-description-1}
==================

An introduction to the foundations of information modeling methods used
in current information management applications. The specific methods
considered include relational database design, conceptual modeling, and
ontologies. The basic concepts underlying these methods are sets,
relations, entities, and logics. Applications considered include
relational database design and RDF/OWL semantic web languages. Set
theory and logic are emphasized as the foundational frameworks for
information modeling in general, and for contemporary web-based
information management and delivery systems (including semantic web
technologies) in particular.

Pre- and Co-requisites
----------------------

None.

Course Overview
===============

Two sorts of students are anticipated and the course objectives are
similar but slightly different for each group. In neither case is prior
relevant knowledge assumed.

-   LIS561 prepares students anticipating generalist responsibilities
    (as directors, managers, general staff, etc.) to be effective
    leaders in making decisions about the design, development, and
    evaluation of information systems, services, and policies, helping
    their organizations and communities deal with all aspects of the
    difficult technology challenges ahead.

-   LIS561 prepares students anticipating careers as technology
    specialists to efficiently acquire and maintain superior information
    modeling skills throughout their careers and to play leadership
    roles in the design, development, and evaluation of information
    systems, services, and policies.

Consistent with the iSchool goal of producing leaders and not just
competent professionals we focus on developing a deep understanding that
will have long-term benefits and prepare students to engage the hardest
problems facing organizations and society.

Of course LIS561 alone cannot fully realize these objectives; it makes a
partial contribution, focusing on the principles and concepts of
information modeling. A partial contribution, but a necessary one: the
connection between a deep understanding of information modeling concepts
and the challenging information management problems facing us today is
profound.

Strategy
--------

The course examines the major modeling approaches currently in use in
information management: relational modeling, conceptual modeling, and
ontologies, focusing on underlying concepts and principles. The course
is thus simultaneously a foundations course and a survey course.

General course policies 
========================

Class attendance and participation are essential components of this
course. As such, I expect everyone to come to class having read the
required material, prepared to critically engage the concepts. If you
must miss class, contact me **in advance** for information on a make-up
activity.

**Use of cell phones and recording devices is prohibited while class is
in session. Laptops may be used for note-taking and access to course
materials only. I can tell! And it will affect your instructor
assessment grade!**

It is also your responsibility to ask questions regarding concepts that
you don't understand. Remember, asking questions is an excellent form of
participation. Please do not be afraid to ask questions; no question is
"dumb."

Writing and Bibliographic Style Resources
=========================================

The iSchool has a Writing Resources Moodle site
<https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=3389> and
iSchool writing coaches also offer free consultations. We highly
recommend this!

The campus-wide Writers Workshop also provides free consultations. For
more information see <http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/>

Academic Integrity
==================

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the
University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to
which we subscribe. By turning in materials for review, you certify that
all work presented is your own and has been done by you independently,
or as a member of a designated group for group assignments. If, in the
course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer,
proper acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style).
Not to do so is to commit plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If
you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes plagiarism and how to
cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of
academic dishonesty will be severe. Students who violate university
standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary action,
including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and suspension or
dismissal from the University.

Statement of Inclusion
======================

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity
Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state\'s premier public university, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign\'s core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution thus
values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research environment,
one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived experiences of a
diverse community and global workforce. We support diversity of
worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social
groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation,
abilities, economic class, religion, and their intersections.

Accessibility Statement
=======================

To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor and
the [Disability Resources and Educational
Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon as possible.

333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to disability@illinois.edu.

Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight
------------------------------------

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that we
take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or even our
lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When we're faced
with any kind of emergency -- like fire, severe weather or if someone is
trying to hurt you -- The [University of Illinois Police
Department](http://police.illinois.edu/safe) recommends three options:
run, hide or fight.
<http://police.illinois.edu/dpsapp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/syllabus-attachment.pdf>.

Assignments and Evaluation
==========================

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable).

+---------------------------+---------------------+

### Grading Scale:

94-100 = A\
90-93 = A-\
87-89 = B+\
83-86 = B\
80-82 = B-\
77-79 = C+\
73-76 = C\
70-72 = C-\
67-69 = D+\
63-66 = D\
60-62 = D-\
59 and below = F

### Group modeling projects

You will be assigned to two groups and contribute to two analysis and
modeling projects over the course of the semester. Some of your work on
these case studies will take place during class, but you will need to
meet as a group outside of class to complete each step of each project.
Your instructors will provide detailed instructions for each of the
projects, but both will require you to prepare an account of the project
domain in written natural language, abstractions in one or more
artificial languages, and one or more diagrams. Deliverables for these
projects will be staged, with three graded assignments per project.

### Homework assignments

You will be assigned written exercises that are based on the required
readings. These assignments will help you assess your understanding of
the material you\'ve read.

### Reading responses

You will write reading response based on prompts provided by the
instructors. This assignment requires you to reflect more thoughtfully
on what you\'ve read than exercises with right and wrong answers.
Typical reading responses are two to four paragraphs in length, and are
graded based on how thoughtfully and lucidly you have engaged with the
prompts.

### In-class exercises

Classroom activities involve practice with the course content and its
application in information modeling scenarios. Engagement with the
problem at hand, cooperation with group members, and thoughtful spoken
and written treatment of issues that arise are the most important
factors in assessing your contributions in this setting, just as they
are in the working world.

Comprehension quizzes are based on the reading assignments, and are
completed in class. Their purpose is to help ensure that you understand
the concepts and methods presented by the authors of our readings.

### Instructor assessment

This grade is a combination of your attendance, in-class participation,
and overall progress throughout the semester; all assessed by your
instructor. You will receive intermediate feedback throughout the
semester.

The following rubric will be used to assign a score:

::: {.DefinitionTerm}
10-Student has been an active participant in class discussion, bringing
to the class insights from their interpretations of readings and lived
experiences and is demonstrating an increasing grasp of the key concepts
covered in class.
:::

::: {.DefinitionTerm}
8-Student has been an active participant in some of the class discussion
and is demonstrating some gains in grasping key concepts covered in
class.
:::

::: {.DefinitionTerm}
6-Student is occasionally active in class and is demonstrating some
learning, but it is clear they are not performing to their full
capabilities.
:::

::: {.DefinitionTerm}
4-Student has missed several classes and/or is not always active when
attending class.
:::

::: {.DefinitionTerm}
0-Student has consistently missed class during the rated period.
:::
