Review the Spring 2017 timetable on this webpage:

http://ischool.illinois.edu/academics/courses/timetables?semester=SP&year=2017

Most of the information on that page is presented in the form of a table, which I'd like you to consider as a single relation. 
Note that although there are only six columns in the table, there are more than six fields.

Using the Kent reading (Kent, W. 1983. “A Simple Guide to Five Normal Forms in Relational Database Theory”. 
Commun. ACM 26.2, 120–125. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/358024.358054 ) as a guide, 
find at least three violations of Third Normal Form in the timetable relation. 
Explain them as clearly as you can in 1-2 pages of text, notation, and (optionally) diagrams.
