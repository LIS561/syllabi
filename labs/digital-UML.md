Construct a UML class diagram for the sets and relationships you modeled as sets and relations in https://github.com/LIS561/syllabi/blob/master/labs/model-research-project-descriptions.md
Upload it here as an SVG file (or a scan/photo of a paper drawing). 
You may also include a copy of the diagram in another file format (such as PNG or PDF) 
if the presentation is more robust and consistent in different viewers.
