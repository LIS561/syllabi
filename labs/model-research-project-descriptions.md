You may find it helpful to revisit Partee, B H. 2006. “Basic Concepts of Set Theory, Functions and Relations”. http://people.umass.edu/partee/NZ_2006/Set%20Theory%20Basics.pdf and for question 3, the discussion of ternary (3-place) relationships Teorey, T J, Yang, D, and Fry, J P. 1986. “A logical design methodology for relational databases using the extended entity-relationship model”. ACM Comput. Surv. 18.2, 197–222. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/7474.7475 may help.

Review the research project descriptions linked from this iSchool web page: http://ischool.illinois.edu/research/projects

Note that each project has its own web page that includes information not on the summary list.

I propose that we model research project descriptions using sets and relations, starting with the following definitions:

* P = {p|p is a research project}.
* A = {a|a is an active research project}. A ⊆ P.
* C = {c|c is a completed research project}. C ⊆ P.
* Q = {q|q is a faculty member or graduate student}.
* I = {<q,p>|q is an investigator for project p}. I ⊆ (Q × P).
Answer the following questions:

1. What definitions would you add to these to model project funding and timeframe information?

2. What other information in the project description can you define in set-theoretic terms?

3. Which (if any) of the relationships you've identified are best modeled using three place or four place relations, instead of binary relations? Explain your reasoning.

4. Do any of the relations you've proposed qualify as functions? Why or why not?

5. How would you interpret the (composition) relation I ∘ I⁻¹

6. Write a paragraph about your observations and comments on modeling with set theory.
