# Instructions
1. In class, explain the activity. 
2. Also explain why we do this: this is a class about teamwork and working together. 
You will work with many different students since we will assign you to different groups each week. 
We also want you to talk and work together OUTSIDE of class, so we want you to meet as many people as you can.
3. Everyone gets a namelist and takes notes on classmates (about 10 minutes)
4. Then the group comes back together and tries to identify faces (about 10 minutes)
5. Discuss what strategies worked for groups, and what didn't work so well.
