As I was comparing our treatment of predicate logic with classes at other universities, I found an introduction at Queens College here: 

http://thatmarcusfamily.org/philosophy/Course_Websites/Logic_S04/Lessons/PredicateIntro.pdf

Two of the exercises caught my attention. Professor Marcus asks his students to translate the following sentences into predicate logic (among many others):

"Dan will see Erika on Tuesday at noon in the gym."

"Blessed is he that considers the poor." (Bx, Cx)

Marcus's answer for the first sentence is simply Sd, where d = Dan, and presumably S is the property of seeing Erika on Tuesday at noon in the gym! But suppose we wanted to unpack that predicate to represent more of the sentence meaning in the structure of the expression (rather than capturing it all with a single predicate). Suggest one or more grammatically conforming predicate logic expressions as steps toward that goal. Be sure to include keys and to specify domains of discourse.

Marcus's answers to the second sentence is:

∀x (Cx → Bx), where Cx = "x considers the poor" and Bx = "x is blessed"

Suppose we wanted to translate this using a two-place predicate Cxy = "x considers y." Suggest two or more different predicate logic expressions that each capture a different interpretation of "Blessed is he that considers the poor." Explain the differences among them.
