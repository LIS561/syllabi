<h1 id="rdf-assignment">RDF Assignment</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select at least five interrelated pieces of information from Assignment 8's EAC-CPF record that you can represent using RDF. By 'interrelated' we mean that the RDF graph that expresses them is at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)">weakly connected</a> (i.e., no vertex is completely disconnected from the others).</li>
<li>Encode the statements you have chosen using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)">turtle syntax</a> for RDF. Store the description in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> text file. Most text editors offer a menu or dialog box option to save in this format.</li>
<li>Confirm that your RDF description conforms to the turtle syntax by converting it to RDF/XML using the <a href="http://www.easyrdf.org/converter">EasyRDF converter</a>. Save the resulting RDF/XML file as a UTF-8 file.</li>
<li>Upload both RDF files here. If you have questions or observations about this exercise, include them in a separate file.</li>
