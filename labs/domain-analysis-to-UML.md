1. Choose either of these two domains: book circulation in a library or online ordering and delivery of prepared food.
Identify at least three entity classes, three binary relationships or associations, 
and one generalization relationship in that domain.

2. Draw either a UML class diagram or an Entity-Relationship diagram depicting that information.
You can do the diagram on paper or in a computer program. For computer programs, I suggest formats such as SVG, PDF, or PNG. 
Write comments about the assignment.
