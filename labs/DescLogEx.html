<h1 id="description-logic-exercise">Description logic exercise</h1>
<p>Imagine an organization in which various <em>activities</em> take place, and where groups, persons, and physical objects that <em>support</em> an activity are deemed <em>resources</em> in virtue of that support role. Define the one-place predicate <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>x</em></span> as being true whenever <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is an activity, and the two-place predicate <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><em>x</em><em>y</em></span> as being true whenever <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> supports <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>. The one-place predicate <span class="math inline"><em>R</em><em>x</em></span> is true if and only if <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is a resource.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Express in predicate logic the rule that something is a resource if it supports some activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your understanding of the description logic reading assignment, try to express the same rule in description logic syntax.</p></li>
</ol>
