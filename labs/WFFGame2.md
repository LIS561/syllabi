title: Advanced Logic Game

Introduction
------------

The advanced version of the logic game is played using the same rules
as the introductory version. However, in this game players use all the
game materials, and there is an additional restriction on the formulas
you may write on the worksheet.

Materials
---------

1. The dice with the logical symbols and the propositional letters are
   used exactly the same as in the introductory game.
2. The six colored plastic cubes correspond to propositional letters
   on the dice:
    - The blue cube corresponds to the letter 'b'.
    - The green cube corresponds to the letter 'g'.
    - The black cube corresponds to the letter 'k'.
    - The orange cube corresponds to the letter 'o'.
    - The pink cube corresponds to the letter 'p'.
3. The tetrahedral (triangular) die is used to generate a random
   number from 1 to 4. The number rolled is the upright number at the
   base of the triangle.


Preparing the game
------------------

Draw two ovals at the top of the playing sheet, labeled "TRUE" and
"FALSE." Each oval should be large enough for all six colored cubes to
fit inside.


Playing the game
----------------

1. Roll the triangular tetrahedral die to determine how many of the six colored cubes should be placed in the "TRUE" oval.
2. Draw that number of colored cubes randomly from the drawstring bag, and place them in the "TRUE" oval. The propositions represented
   by these cubes are understood to be true.
3. Place the remaining colored cubes in the "FALSE" oval. The propositions represented by these cubes are understood to be false.
4. Shake and throw the six dice, just as you did in the introductory game.
5. Each group member writes a conforming expression using as many symbols as possible, just as in the introductory game. But
   **the entire formula must be true with respect to the truth values of the available propositional letters**. 


Example of Game Play
--------------------

Brett, Ian, Kavya, Linh, Melina, and Zhang are playing again.  Brett
rolls a 2 on the tetrahedral die, and Zhang draws two colored cubes at
random from the drawstring bag.  These turn out to be the orange cube
and the blue cube, and so Zhang put them in the "TRUE" oval, and the
other four colored cubes in the "FALSE" oval.


Kavya rolls the six white dice and generates the following results: p,
r, k, →, →, ∧. Kavya places the p, r and k results near the "FALSE"
oval as a reminder that propositions p, r and k (the pink, red and
black cubes) are false.

Melina will write the first expression. It's achallenging exercise,
because the three available propositions are false, but the conforming
expression that includes them must be true. But Melina remembers that
an implication can be true if both the antecedent and consequent are
false. So she begins by writing $(p \rightarrow r)$ and then remembers
that an implication is also true if the antecedent is false and the
consequent is true.  Melina extends the expression to
$(k \rightarrow (p \rightarrow r))$.

Zhang writes the next expression $(r \rightarrow (p \wedge k))$, since
that is another implication where both the antecedent and consequent
are false.
