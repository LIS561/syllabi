For the https://github.com/LIS561/syllabi/blob/master/labs/normal-form-violations.md exercise you considered a timetable of course offerings, and identified violations of third normal form. In this exercise you will propose a set of relation schemas for course and course session information that satisfies the requirements for third normal form.

1. Read the first seven pages (sections 1 and 2) of Wenholz's introduction to relational algebra posted here: http://buzzard.ups.edu/courses/2012spring/projects/wenholz-relational-algebra-ups-434-2012.pdf
2. A relation schema is an ordered tuple of database fields like the one we considered in discussing the last exercise: <*Course, Name, CRN, Schedule, Location, Instructor>. But most database designs will include a set of relation schemas that can be combined together by join operations to provide data tuples that satisfy queries. Make sure you understand how joins work, then review the Kent summary of normal form requirements again.
Propose a set of relation schemas that satisfy the constraints of third normal form, and that preserve all the information provided in the timetable (course meeting times, classrooms, instructors, etc.)
3. Add your comments on the exercise.
