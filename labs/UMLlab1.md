# UML drafting exercise

1. Look again at the Exit and Exit Access Requirements (section 35.23)
   in the University of Idaho APM, and reflect on the set theoretic
   definitions you proposed in the last exercise
   <https://www.uidaho.edu/apm/35/23>.

2. Working together as a group draft a UML diagram on paper that includes
   all of the following classes:
     - Exit
     - Door
     - Corridor
     - Stairway
     - Stairwell
     - Room
     - Walkway

   If you decide that an important unary property applies to a class,
   include it in the rectangle as an attribute, but don't worry about
   what its data type would be.

3. Draw as many of the important relationships from section 35.23 as
   you can agree on as a group. Add any additional classes you need
   for the end points of these relationships. These relationships and
   additional classes can have whatever names you decide are
   meaningful, but for this exercise use only the generalization arrow and
   the association link for relationships (not composition or aggregation).
   Be sure that the associations are labeled, and that the directionality
   of the association is indicated with a black triangle.

4. Near the end of the allotted time for this exercise, one person in
   your group should photograph the progress you've made and post it
   on behalf of the group to the Moodle forum for this week. The
   second memo exercise requires that you complete the diagram on your
   own, redrawing using the Dia editor.
