Imagine an organization in which various activities take place, and where groups, persons, and physical objects that support an activity are deemed resources in virtue of that support role. Define the one-place predicate Ax as being true whenever x is an activity, and the two-place predicate Sxy as being true whenever x supports y. The one-place predicate Rx is true if and only if x is a resource.

1. Express in predicate logic the rule that something is a resource if it supports some activity.

2. Based on your understanding of the description logic reading assignment, try to express the same rule in description logic syntax.
