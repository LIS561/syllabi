# Harvard Employee Manual & Propositional Logic PART ONE
1. Review sections A-G of "Types of Employment" in the Harvard University Staff Employee Manual. The page is at this address: http://hr.harvard.edu/staff-personnel-manual/requirements-conditions-employment/types-employment
2. Section A begins with this sentence: "Regular employees are regularly scheduled to work 17.5 hours or more per week for a period exceeding 90 days in duration and/or will be regularly paid at the rate of at least $15,000 per year." Should the "and/or" be understood as a logical conjunction or a logical disjunction in this case? How do you know?
3. Express the logical form of that sentence as an implication. Your sentence should have the conjunction or disjunction you chose for number 1 on the left-hand-side (called the 'antecdent'). Include English sentence glosses that define any propositional letters appearing in the formula.  Your answer should conform to the syntactic constraints of propositional logic, and capture as much of the sentence meaning as possible within the expressive limitations of propositional logic. 

4. Send emisarries to another group to compare your results.

5. Provide examples expressed elsewhere in the Harvard University Staff Employee Manual for the following. Express each one in propositional logic using the same guidelines as those in step 3.
* 5a) conjunction
* 5b) disjunction
* 5c) implication

6. Find some assumptions. What isn't stated, but has to be true for the text to make sense?

7. Send emisarries to another group to compare your results.

* 8. Using the same guidelines as those in step 3 and 4, express assumptions in propositional logic that are:
* 8a) conjunction
* 8b) disjunction

8. Determine how to write logic symbols with your computer. Hint: you might open up a keyboard caps program or copy/paste the symbols from a website like Wikipedia.

9. Post to this lab's forum with a paragraph of comments and reflections on challenges for analyzing these policies.
