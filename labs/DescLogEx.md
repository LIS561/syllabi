# Description logic exercise

Imagine an organization in which various *activities* take place, and
where groups, persons, and physical objects that *support* an activity
are deemed *resources* in virtue of that support role. Define the one-place
predicate $Ax$ as being true whenever $x$ is an activity, and the two-place
predicate $Sxy$ as being true whenever $x$ supports $y$. The one-place predicate
$Rx$ is true if and only if $x$ is a resource.

1. Express in predicate logic the rule that something is a resource if it supports some activity.

2. Based on your understanding of the description logic reading assignment, try to express the same rule
   in description logic syntax.
