# Information Modeling
 - This class is called "Information Modeling."
 - That suggests the course is about modeling information.
 - But we're actually going to learn about modeling parts of the world.
 - It's more accurate to say we'll be modeling *with* information,
 - or modeling for purposes of keeping track of information.

# Today
 - Today I want to introduce some vocabulary in an informal way.
 - Over the next few weeks we will explore more formal understandings of these concepts.
 - Tonight I'll introduce you to a diagrammatic notation that we'll come back to in later presentations.

# Reality and Domains of Discourse
 - We will introduce formal definitions of a domain of discourse later.
 - For today, we'll define a domain of discourse as some part of reality
   that we wish to represent in a model.
 - Consider three categories of things we might believe are real:
   physical things, abstract things, and social things [@jubien_platonism_1997; @ferraris_social_2011].

# Physical things

Physical things exist in space and time: if they exist, then there is
some place and time where we can find them. Examples include:

 - the particular chair you're sitting in right now,
 - particular sound waves reaching your ears at this moment,
 - the electric current circulating through wires in this room,
 - the seat back that is part of your chair
 - any specific atomic particle from which the chair is composed.

# Social things

Social things exist in time, but not in space. Examples include:

 - my marriage,
 - the mortgage on my house,
 - the promise I made to my wife to remember to pay the mortgage on time,
 - the University of Illinois School of Information Sciences.

# Abstract things

Abstract things are not found in the physical universe. They don't come into
existence, nor are they destroyed or modified. Examples include:

 - The number eleven,
 - Every physically possible configuration of Lego building blocks,
 - The property of being red,
 - the proposition that I am employed by the University if Illinois,
 - the relationship "employed by the University of Illinois,"
 - the state of affairs "Dave's being employed by the University of Illinois."

# Properties
Michael Jubien (1997) offers an accessible introduction to the Platonistic conception of
abstract things like properties. A property, he says, is "a way something can be."
His examples include:

 - green
 - hot
 - slimy
 - hungry
 - four-legged
 - dead
 - married
 - flat
 - soluble
 - "having been a female US President before 1997"

# Relationships
Jubien uses the term "relation" for a part of abstract reality that I'll call "relationship,"
so as to keep it distinct from a mathematical object that might or might not be the same thing.
Jubien's examples of relation(ships) include:

 - the "betweenness" relationship that can obtain among integers (like 4 is between 3 and 5);
 - the "betweenness" relationship that can obtain physical objects in space;
 - the instantiation relationship that can link a property to a particular thing that exemplifies the property;

# Relational properties

 - Jubien distinguishes between the "love" relationship obtaining between Jack and Jill
   and the relational properties "being loved by Jack," and "being loved by Jill."
 - In several of the models we shall examine in this class, all properties are *reduced*
   to relationships.
 - In models such as RDF, these relational properties can only obtain between
   exactly two individuals (binary relationships only).

# Propositions

 - Propositions are abstract bearers of truth values.
 - That is to say, they're the kinds of things that can be true or false.
 - Propositions are language-independent entities. You can think of
   them as the information content of simple declarative sentences.
 - The Platonistic conception of propositions has them outside of
   time and space.
 - So a proposition is not in your mind: it's the kind of thing with respect to which you can
   stand in a relationship such as belief or desire.

# States of Affairs
- Maria E. Reicher [-@reicher_2009] characterizes the "standard conception" of
  states of affairs as: "complex entities, consisting of particulars,
  (universal) properties and relations, such that an atomic state of
  affairs is a particular's exemplifying a property (or one or more
  particulars' exemplifying a relation)."
- States of affairs are the parts of reality responsible for making
  propositions true or false.

# Summary of concepts

- **Domain of discourse**: some part of reality that we wish to represent in a model.
- **Physical object**: Something that's bounded in both time and space.
- **Abstract object**: Something that's bounded in neither time nor space, but may have a physical expression or instantiation.
- **Social object**: Something bounded in time, but not space, and is essentially connected to the context of its creation.
- **Property**: A way something could be.
- **Relationship**: A way two or more things could be with respect to each other.
- **Relational property**: A way something could be in virtue of its particpation in a relationship.
- **Proposition**: A language-independent bearer of truth values and object of propositional attitudes like belief.
- **State of affairs**: A particular's exemplifying a property, or one or more
  particulars' exemplifying a relation.
