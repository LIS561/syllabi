×∈⊆∉⊈σΠ

## Important definitions from the Kent reading

- Under second and third normal forms, a nonkey field must provide a
  fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.

- Third normal form is violated when a nonkey field is a fact about
  another nonkey field.

- A field Y is "functionally dependent" on a field (or fields) X if it
  is invalid to have two records with the same X value but different Y
  values.

## Recall from Partee

- A relation F ⊆ (A × B) is a function (or mapping) F:A→B if and only
  if the domain of F is A and F pairs every element in that domain
  with exactly one element in the range.
