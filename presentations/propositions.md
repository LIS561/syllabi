# What are propositions?

- In our readings and exercises we've seen *propositions* represented using
  lower case letters (and colored plastic cubes during the logic game).
- But what exactly is a proposition? And how is it different from a sentence?
- Not everyone agrees on what propositions *really* are, but many people agree
  that propositions:
     - are the bearers of truth values,
     - the information content of declarative sentences,
     - language independent, and
     - objects of propositional attitudes.

# Propositions are the kinds of things that can be either true or false

- Some examples of sentences that express propositions:
    - "This table is made of wood."
    - "Twenty five is a prime number."
- Meaningful language that expresses no proposition:
    - "five grams of copper"
    - "built in Ohio"
    - "is related by marriage to"
- Sentences where propositions play more complicated roles:
    - "Go away!"
    - "Thank you for the thoughtful gift."
    
# Language independent information content

- Two different sentences can express the same proposition.
- The German sentence "Dieser Tisch ist aus Holz"
  has the same meaning as the English sentence
  "This table is made of wood."
- We could use those sentences to express the same proposition, as long
  as we were talking about the same table.
- The proposition expressed by both sentences would not be in either English
  or German.

# Sentences vs. utterances

- An utterance is an event: a specific instance of a sentence being spoken.
- If I speak the same sentence twice, that's one sentence but two utterances.
- Two utterances of the same sentence may express the same or different propositions.
- People use language for different purposes, and we sometimes group utterances into
  categories called "speech acts."

# Speech acts and sentences

- If I say "John and Mary are married," I might be asserting my belief that John and Mary are married.
- But if a minister says "John and Mary are married," in the context of officiating at a wedding, then saying the words makes it true.
- The propositonal content is the same, but the first utterance is an *assertion*, and the second is a *declaration*.

# Speech acts and sentences

- If I say "We will arrive on time," I might be asserting my belief that we won't be late.
- Or I might be promising to drive fast enough to keep us from being late.
- The propositional content is the same, but the first utterance is an *assertion*, and the second is a *commisive* utterance.

# Other Speech Acts

- John Searle proposes assertives, commisives, declarations, and also these categories:
- *Expressives* express how the speaker feels about the truth or falsity of a proposition
  (e.g., "Thank you for the thoughtful gift").
- *Directives* are a speaker's attempt to make the listener do something
  (e.g., "Go away!").

# The objects of propositional attitudes
- Propositional attitudes are psychological relationships between people and propositions.
- Uttering "Seventeen is a prime number" usually communicates a *belief* attitude.
- "I'm sorry I stepped on your foot," typically communicates *regret*.
- "I hope Atlanta wins the game," typically communicates *desire*.
