# Properties
Michael Jubien (1997) offers an accessible introduction to the Platonistic conception of
abstract things like properties. A property, he says, is "a way something can be" [@jubien_platonism_1997].
His examples include:

 - green
 - hot
 - slimy
 - hungry
 - four-legged
 - dead
 - married
 - flat
 - soluble
 - "having been a female US President before 1997"

# Relationships
Jubien uses the term "relation" for a part of abstract reality that I'll call "relationship,"
so as to keep it distinct from a mathematical object that might or might not be the same thing.
Jubien's examples of relation(ships) include:

 - the "betweenness" relationship that can obtain among integers (like 4 is between 3 and 5);
 - the "betweenness" relationship that can obtain physical objects in space;
 - the instantiation relationship that can link a property to a particular thing that exemplifies the property;

# Relational properties

 - Jubien distinguishes between the "love" relationship obtaining between Jack and Jill
   and the relational properties "being loved by Jack," and "being loved by Jill."
 - In several of the models we shall examine in this class, all properties are *reduced*
   to relationships.
 - In models such as RDF, these relational properties can only obtain between
   exactly two individuals (binary relationships only).
