# Psalm 41:1
- "Blessed is he who considers the poor."
- Professor Marcus is looking for the answer ${\forall}x (Cx \rightarrow Bx)$
    - where $Cx$ means "x considers the poor"
    - and $Bx$ means "x is blessed."
- Suppose we want $C$ to be a two-place predicate, where the first
  argument represents the considering agent, and the second whatever
  receives the consideration.
- The most straightforward modification would be ${\forall}x (Cxp \rightarrow Bx)$
    - where individual $p$ ("the poor") picks out one or more poor
      persons in our domain of discourse.
    - The expression ${\forall}x{\forall}y (Cxy \rightarrow Bx)$ won't
      work, since that would be "blessed is he who considers anyone."
    - Using a propositional constant like $p$ presents a problem, but
      not because it represents an individual. An individual can be
      any identifiable thing in our domain, including a group.
