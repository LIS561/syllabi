==For Group Project 1==
	- Start earlier in the semester 
	- Better framing or narrative for the Group Project
	- Add memos
	- Ten days between deliverables
	- Grading: have TAs do initial first pass
	- Use ER/EER work as a modeling language for the project (in part because E&R text uses ER diagrams, in part because students think UML Class diagrams are for automatic OOP)
	- Skills/knowledge necessary for group project 1: requirements analysis and competency questions, UML (or ER) diagraming, relational mapping from conceptual design, writing structured queries.
	- Clarify why 1A needs to be in the form of Y/N questions
	- Add more guidance for introduction & conclusion for 1B


==For Group Project 2==
	- "the art of data modeling"
	- be very prescriptive
	- give comparison of different modeling approaches on concrete examples
	- consider whether there is better software than Protégé
	- can we break this up to allow each student to have a part to do?
	- Grading: have TAs do initial first pass -- some things are easier to check in a text file (e.g. ex: and rdfs:label), others have specific places in the interface to check
	- consider whether we want to take points off when too many classes are given, when object properties are given inverses that don't appear on the diagram etc.
	- clarify what a good data property is
	- Stress classes vs. instances, good resource is "Expressing Knowledge" on pages 8-10 from the Overview of Semantic Technologies:
https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/pluginfile.php/373871/mod_resource/content/0/Overview-of-Semantic-Technologies.pdf (this relates to the data property issue)
	- specify conventions, e.g. what should be lowercase
	- rubric for 2B needs to include distinctness of individuals
	- clarify the requirement descriptions for 2B (object property assertions for individuals)
	- In 2C fix #7 and #8 to say appointed instead of assigned
	- clarify the relationship between the individuals from 2B and the individuals for 2C
	- figure out what we need from the crashing Protege exercise in order to do 2C


==Both group assignments==
	- integrate writing support

==Pretest/posttest==
	- Consider whether we want UML and ER on the pre/post - test
	- Clarify SQL questions in pre/post test and how we intend to grade them
	- Do the post test in week 3

==Homework==
	- Clarify SQL questions in pre/post test and how we intend to grade them and homework assignments 
	- Fix diagram in HW #8 or add clarification

==Topic sequencing==
	- Talk about domain and range as concepts in logic right after the Idaho Sets and Relations worksheet
	- Course sequencing and group projects. Be sure we are covering the ideas required before we ask them to use them.
	- XML early in semester (Documents and Document Modeling? Slides 2-6 and 20-27)

==Topics==
	- Add Requirements Analysis as a course topic or theme
	- Emphasize Schema level versus Instance level information
	- Make more explicit connections to things like data structures and computational processing

==TA's==
	- Make lists of what needs to be done (parcel off more tasks for TAs)
	- Have TA's make a first pass at grading group projects

==Admin==
	- Use one edition of E&N Database Textbook book for chapters
	- Revise the catalog description.
	
==Individual Memos==
	- Can we have extra grading support and/or integration of writing support that would make it feasible to do individual memos that are started in class with the group but completed individually?





==For prerequisites==
Consider:
- Are there any class activities that would benefit from projection of a single shared document (e.g. etherpad).
- Multiple choice questions can be used to assess prior background

Example from Carpentries workshop:

Have you ever participated in a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry Workshop?
 
	1	Yes, I have taken a workshop. 
	2	Yes, I have been a workshop helper. 
	3	Yes, I organized a workshop. 
	4	No, but I am familiar with what is taught at a workshop. 
	5	No, and I am not familiar with what is taught at a workshop. 
 
Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?
 
	1	I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course. 
	2	I have not had any teaching experience in the past. 
	3	I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.
	4	I have been the instructor-of-record for my own university/college course.
	5	I have taught at the primary education level.
	6	I have taught informally through outreach programs, hackathons, laboratory demonstrations, and similar activities. 

==For group work==
Consider having "flags" for each group --- need help, done.
