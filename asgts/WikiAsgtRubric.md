Students are to add a page to the Wiki for our Sandbox
repository. They must include an inline vector graphics image from a
file that they have stored in the Wiki's repository.

- 2 points if the student has created a new Wiki page anywhere on GitHub?
- 2 points for creating a vector diagram in SVG format?
- 2 points for including an inline image (of any kind) in the wiki page?
- 2 points for submitting the URL on the moodle assignment page, as directed.
- 4 points for editing the Wiki for the IS561 Sandbox repository with this contribution?
- 8 points for having all files for this assignment part of the correct shared repository (the wiki's)

Maximum 20 points for everything right.

Key examples:

- If everything is correct, except that the inline SVG file is linked
  from somewhere other than the Wiki repository, then that's 12 points.

- If the student has forked the repository because he or she never got
  access, and did everything right in their own GitHub space then that's
  8 points.

- If everything is right except the SVG file is linked without
  appearing inline, then that's 18 points.
