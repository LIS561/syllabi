## Homework Assignment 2: Relations and relational modeling

Part 1. Let S be the set of all students enrolled for Fall semester 2019 at the School of Information Sciences.

Question 1. Write, in English, a precise definition for a specific
relation over S that is *symmetric.* Explain in no more than three
sentences why that particular relation is symmetric.

Question 2. Same instructions as Question 1, but define a specific
*antisymmetric* relation, and justify that property. This should be a
different relation than those you've described so far.

Question 3. Same instructions as Question 1, but define a specific
*reflexive* relation, and justify that property.  This should be a
different relation than those you've described so far.

Question 4. Same instructions as Question 1, but define a specific
*irreflexive* relation, and justify that property.  This should be a
different relation than those you've described so far.

Question 5. Same instructions as Question 1, but define a specific
*transitive* relation, and justify that property. This should be a
different relation than those you've described so far.


Part 2. Consider the following ER Diagram for recipes. Note that the
only attribute shown that uniquely defines an entity instance is the
URL attribute for recipes; "index number" identifies the ordinal
position in a sequence of steps, and two or more ingredients may have
the same name. Preparation times are in minutes. Recipe categories
include dessert, appetizer, entree, etc. Food types include nut, meat,
etc.

Question 6. Translate this diagram into a relational schema, following
the guidelines discussed in class. Define your own primary key fields.

Question 7. Write relational algebra expressions (not SQL syntax) for
the following queries, using the relational schema you wrote for the
Question 6:

a. Names and URLs for recipes that can be prepared in less than thirty
minutes that require eggs (but no more than three eggs).

b. Names, and preparation times for dessert recipes that require no nuts.

c. A query of your own devising that requires a join, selection, and projection.

Part 3: Optional extra credit.  Define relation $Q$ over set $S$ of
students as $\langle s,t \rangle \in Q$ if students $s$ and $t$ are
enrolled together in a Fall 2019 semester class. Is $Q$ an
*equivalence relation* or not? Review *each* of the criteria for
equivalence relations, and explain in careful English how $Q$ either
meets or fails to meet each criterion.


### Rationale

The aims of this assignment are for you to:

1. Understand relational properties' application in domain examples,
   not just as they're described in textbooks. This aim is connected
   to the course learning outcome of abstraction as a tool for
   modeling domain objects.

2. Execute the guidelines for producing a relational schema from an ER
   diagram. This aim supports the course learning outcome of analysis
   and choice of appropriate modeling structures.

3. Demonstrate an understanding of relational algebra as a basis for
   query languages. This aim supports the course learning outcome of
   recognizing formalisms and methods underlying information systems.

Your written justifications for the relational properties support the
course learning outcome of articulating system limitations based on
underlying mathematical formalisms. This assignment supports the
broader, program level outcomes of using best practices for
information management and knowledge representation, and communicating
the implications of analytical results.

### Grading rubric

Questions 1-5:

- N points each for relations that actually have the required property;
- an additonal 0-M points for relations that have the property non-vacuously and non-trivially;
- an additional 0-P points for original proposals that show the student has thought about the problem;
- an additional 0-Q points for clarity of the justification.
