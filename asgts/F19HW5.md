## Homework Assignment 5: Predicate logic

Logic symbols: ∀ ∃ ¬ () → ↔ ∧ ∨


Problem 1: In our recipes model, the domain of the 'includes'
relationship is *recipe,* while the codomain is *step*. In other words,
recipes include steps. In Datalog these constraints are written like this:

~~~~~~~~~~
recipe(Recipe) :- includes(Recipe,_).
step(Step) :- includes(_,Step).
~~~~~~~~~~

Let the unary predicates **Rx** and **Sx** denote that *x* is a
recipe and a step, respectively. Let the binary predicate **Ixy**
denote the **includes** relationship (x includes y). Using these
predicates and the symbols listed above, write out the domain and
codomain constraints in predicate logic.

Problem 2. Write a *single* predicate logic implication that
represents both of the following Datalog relationships. Be sure to
include an explanation of what each predicate denotes.

~~~~~~~~~~
quantity(Q) :- quantinpounds(Q,_).
quantity(Q) :- quantinliters(Q,_).
~~~~~~~~~~

Problem 3.  Consider the following Datalog transcript and then write
an existentially quantified predicate logic statement that is **true**
in light of what you see:

~~~~~~~~~~
DES> requires(X,Y)
 
{
  requires(sccs,chicken)
}
Info: 1 tuple computed.
~~~~~~~~~~

Problem 4: Write an English sentence that states the same thing as the following predicate logic expression.

~~~~~~~~~~
∀x∀y∀z((Rxz ∧ Szy) → ∃w(Tw ∧ Nxwy))

where: 
Rxy means recipe x requires ingredient y,
Sxy means ingredient x must satisfy property y,
Nxyz means recipe x needs tool y to realize property z.
~~~~~~~~~~
