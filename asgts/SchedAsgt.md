## Scheduling Assignment


Adapted from Aldous and Wilson, 2000
Students assigned to project groups need to meet together. We wish to
book the smallest number of meeting rooms and times that we can, which
means scheduling meetings at the same time if possible.

If the students are identified by letter, and the groups by number,
what's the smallest number of rooms and times that we can book while
ensuring that no student will miss a meeting? Produce a timetable of
meeting times and places.
