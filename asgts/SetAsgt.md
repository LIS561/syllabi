# Set Assignment
Review the research project descriptions linked from this iSchool web page:
<http://ischool.illinois.edu/research/projects>

Note that each project has its own web page that includes information not
on the summary list.

I propose that we model research project descriptions using sets and
relations, starting with the following definitions:

- P = {p|p is a research project}.
- A = {a|a is an active research project}. A ⊆ P.
- C = {c|c is a completed research project}. C ⊆ P.
- Q = {q|q is a faculty member or graduate student}.
- I = {<q,p>|q is an investigator for project p}. I ⊆ (Q × P).

Answer the following questions:

1. What definitions would you add to these to model project funding
   and timeframe information?

2. What other information in the project description can you define in
   set-theoretic terms?

3. Which (if any) of the relationships you've identified are best
   modeled using three way or four ways relations, instead of binary
   relations? Explain your reasoning.

4. Do any of the relations you've proposed qualify as functions? Why
   or why not?

5. How would you interpret the relation I ∘ I⁻¹
