# Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of information modeling methods
used in current information management applications. The specific methods
considered include relational database design, conceptual modeling,
and ontologies. The basic concepts underlying these
methods are sets, relations, entities, and
logics. Applications considered include relational database design
and RDF/OWL semantic web languages. Set theory and logic are emphasized as the
foundational frameworks for information modeling in general, and for
contemporary web-based information management and delivery systems
(including semantic web technologies) in particular.


## Pre- and Co-requisites

None.


# Course Overview

Two sorts of students are anticipated and the course
objectives are similar but slightly different for each group. In
neither case is prior relevant knowledge assumed.

- LIS561 prepares students anticipating generalist responsibilities
  (as directors, managers, general staff, etc.) to be effective
  leaders in making decisions about the design, development, and
  evaluation of information systems, services, and policies, helping
  their organizations and communities deal with all aspects of the
  difficult technology challenges ahead.
- LIS561 prepares students anticipating careers as technology
  specialists to efficiently acquire and maintain superior information
  modeling skills throughout their careers and to play leadership
  roles in the design, development, and evaluation of information
  systems, services, and policies.

Consistent with the iSchool goal of producing leaders and not just
competent professionals we focus on developing a deep understanding
that will have long-term benefits and prepare students to engage the
hardest problems facing organizations and society.

Of course LIS561 alone cannot fully realize these objectives; it
makes a partial contribution, focusing on the principles and concepts
of information modeling. A partial contribution, but a necessary one:
the connection between a deep understanding of information modeling
concepts and the challenging information management problems facing us
today is profound.

## Strategy

The course examines the major modeling approaches currently
in use in information management: relational modeling, conceptual
modeling, and ontologies, focusing on underlying concepts
and principles. The course is thus simultaneously a foundations course
and a survey course.



## Learning Objectives

1. Develop fluency in reading and understanding formal definitions.
2. Understand the role of abstraction in making systems design choices.
3. Contrast deep vs. superficial differences in modeling languages.
4. Recognize practical implications of trading expressive power for tractability.
5. Appreciate the fundamental role of a very small set of inter-related concepts.



# Course Materials

All required readings for this class are available online. They
are listed in the references section at the end of this syllabus.

# Writing and Bibliographic Style Resources
The iSchool has a Writing Resources Moodle site
<https://courses.ischool.illinois.edu/course/view.php?id=1705> and
iSchool writing coaches also offer free consultations. We highly recommend this!

The campus-wide Writers Workshop also provides free consultations. For more
information see <http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/> 


# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.

# Accessibility Statement
To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.


## Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – The [University of Illinois Police
Department](http://police.illinois.edu/safe) recommends three options:
[Run, hide or
fight](http://police.illinois.edu/dpsapp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/syllabus-attachment.pdf).


# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable).

**Assignments, Exercises & Grade Distribution:**

- Eleven graded assignments (due 1 hour before class meeting in the week they are due): 5 points each (55 points total).
- Eleven ungraded exercises (due 25 hours before class meeting in the week they are due): 2 points each for completion (22 points total).
- Four reading responses: 5 points each (20 points total).
- Attendance and participation in class and on forums: 3 points. 



**Grading Scale:**

| 94-100 = A
| 90-93 = A-
| 87-89 = B+
| 83-86 = B
| 80-82 = B-
| 77-79 = C+
| 73-76 = C
| 70-72 = C-
| 67-69 = D+
| 63-66 = D
| 60-62 = D-
| 59 and below = F

**Reading Responses**

Up to twenty points are available for four critical questions
posted to the class discussion forum and identified in the subject
line as a *reading response* together with a topic description. Critical questions are carefully worded
descriptions of an obstacle to understanding and applying concepts and
methods covered in the assigned readings. These need to be more than
a simple request for clarifying a term or idea. Each question should be
one to three paragraphs in length, and should include:

- A one sentence summary of the question (citing the location of the anomalous passage in the reading);
- A longer, lucid explanation of the question and the obstacle that it identifies;
- A justification for why the question is important;
- Some remarks on the context in which the question arose: how did you recognize that it was a problem?
