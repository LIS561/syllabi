 <sylsec id="scope">
    <sectl>Scope and Objectives</sectl>
    <p>An introduction to the foundations of the information modeling
methods used in current digital library applications as well as in
information management in general. The specific methods considered are
relational database design, conceptual modeling, markup systems, and
ontologies. The basic concepts underlying these methods are,
respectively, relations, entities, grammars, and logic.
Implementations include relational database design, ER/EER/UML
diagrams, XML markup languages, and RDF/OWL semantic web languages.
First order logic is emphasized throughout as the foundational
framework for information modeling in general, and for contemporary
web-based information management and delivery systems (including
semantic web technologies) in particular.</p>
    <sylsubsec id="objectives">
      <subtl>Objectives</subtl>
      <p>Two sorts of students are anticipated and the course
objectives are similar but slightly different for each group. In
neither case is prior relevant knowledge assumed.</p>
      <itemize>
	<item>LIS561 prepares students anticipating generalist
responsibilities (as directors, managers, general staff, etc.) to be
effective leaders in making decisions about the design, development,
and evaluation of information systems, services, and policies, helping
their organizations and communities deal with all aspects of the
difficult technology challenges ahead.
</item>
	<item>LIS561 prepares students anticipating careers as technology
specialists to efficiently acquire and maintain superior information
modeling skills throughout their careers and to play leadership roles
in the design, development, and evaluation of information systems,
services, and policies.</item>
      </itemize>
      <p>Consistent with the GSLIS goal of producing leaders
and not just competent professionals we focus on
developing a deep understanding that will have long-term benefits and
prepare students to engage the hardest problems facing organizations
and society.</p>
      <p>Of course LIS561 alone cannot fully realize these objectives; it
makes a partial contribution, focusing on the principles and concepts
of information modeling. A partial contribution, but a necessary one:
the connection between a deep understanding of information modeling
concepts and the challenging information management problems facing us
today is profound.</p>
    </sylsubsec>
    <sylsubsec>
      <subtl>Strategy</subtl>
      <p>The course examines the major modeling approaches currently
in use in information management: relational modeling, conceptual
modeling, XML markup, and ontologies, focusing on underlying concepts
and principles. The course is thus simultaneously a foundations course
and a survey course. There are several important cross-cutting
themes:</p>
      <itemize>
	<item>Data independence through abstraction.</item>
	<item>The interdefinability of fundamental modeling constructs.</item>
	<item>Deep vs. superficial differences in modeling languages.</item>
	<item>The expressiveness vs. tractability tradeoff.</item>
	<item>The fundamental role of a very small set of inter-related concepts.</item>
      </itemize>
    </sylsubsec>
  <sylsec id="syllabus">
    <sectl>This Syllabus</sectl> 
    <p>The official syllabus for this course is the SGML version that
is linked off the class web page. Expressions of the syllabus in other
formats are derived from the SGML version. The current SGML version
should be consulted to resolve any inconsistencies among other
renditions.</p>
  </sylsec>
  <sylsec id="inclusion">
    <sectl>Statement of Inclusion</sectl>
    <p>The following expression is adopted from the Chancellor's
Commitment Statement of November 2012:</p>
    <p>As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of world views, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.</p>
      <p>The readings and discussion topics for our class meetings are
selected with the aim of encouraging reflection and discussion, but
those choices are not socially or culturally neutral. Where we may be
missing opportunities to align the class content and conduct with the
values expressed in the inclusion statement, students are encouraged
to call classmate and instructor attention to those issues.</p>
  </sylsec>
  <newpage>
  <sylsec id="disability">
    <sectl>Disability Statement</sectl>
    <p>To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon
as possible. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign,
call 217-333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to disability@uiuc.edu.</p>
  </sylsec>
  <sylsec id="grading">
    <sectl>Basis for Grading and Evaluation</sectl>
    <p>The most important standards for success in a class like this
one are the educational goals that students bring to the class. Your
instructors hope that the activities, assignments, and presentations
planned for this semester will be instrumental in your achieving the
goals you set for yourself. Each exercise and assignment has been
selected to provide an experience that will foster your own learning.
Do not think that grading and evaluative feedback are meant as
assesments of your success or failure in the class: they are provided
as an incentive to engage with the material to the best of your
ability, and as a diagnostic, to make sure we find out if you're not
getting the benefits that the assignments should provide.
</p>
<p>Final grades will be calculated as follows:
    <itemize>
      <item>Homework Assignments: 90&percnt;</item>
      <item>Class Participation: 10&percnt;</item>
    </itemize>
    <sylsubsec id="honesty">
      <subtl>On Adapting the Work of Others</subtl>
      <p>Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are
not limited to) creativity and the amount of original work
demonstrated in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use
and adapt the work of others, provided that the following guidelines
are followed:
<itemize>
<item>Use of other people's material must not infringe the copyright
of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing
agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect to
copyrighted material.
<item>Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and
author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment.
Summarize (e.g. using source code comments) the changes or adaptations
that have been made. Make  plain how much of the assignment represents
original work. 
</itemize>
    </sylsubsec>
    <sylsubsec>
      <subtl>Class Participation</subtl>
      <p>The class participation grade is based on consistent attendance,
contribution to in-class and/or online discussions, and providing assistance
to classmates outside of class. Please alert the instructor if a classmate
has been of help to you outside of class.</p>
