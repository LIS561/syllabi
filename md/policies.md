# General course policies 

Class attendance and participation are essential components of this
course. As such, I expect everyone to come to class having read the
required material, prepared to critically engage the concepts. If you
must miss class, contact me **in advance** for information on a make-up
activity.

Use of cell phones and recording devices is prohibited while class is
in session.

It is also your responsibility to ask questions regarding concepts that
you don't understand. Remember, asking questions is an excellent form of
participation. Please do not be afraid to ask questions; no question is
"dumb."
