# Course Overview

Two sorts of students are anticipated and the course
objectives are similar but slightly different for each group. In
neither case is prior relevant knowledge assumed.

- LIS561 prepares students anticipating generalist responsibilities
  (as directors, managers, general staff, etc.) to be effective
  leaders in making decisions about the design, development, and
  evaluation of information systems, services, and policies, helping
  their organizations and communities deal with all aspects of the
  difficult technology challenges ahead.
- LIS561 prepares students anticipating careers as technology
  specialists to efficiently acquire and maintain superior information
  modeling skills throughout their careers and to play leadership
  roles in the design, development, and evaluation of information
  systems, services, and policies.

Consistent with the iSchool goal of producing leaders and not just
competent professionals we focus on developing a deep understanding
that will have long-term benefits and prepare students to engage the
hardest problems facing organizations and society.

Of course LIS561 alone cannot fully realize these objectives; it
makes a partial contribution, focusing on the principles and concepts
of information modeling. A partial contribution, but a necessary one:
the connection between a deep understanding of information modeling
concepts and the challenging information management problems facing us
today is profound.

## Strategy

The course examines the major modeling approaches currently
in use in information management: relational modeling, conceptual
modeling, and ontologies, focusing on underlying concepts
and principles. The course is thus simultaneously a foundations course
and a survey course.



## Learning Objectives

### Content Objectives
1. Develop fluency in reading and understanding formal definitions.
2. Understand the role of abstraction in making systems design choices.
3. Contrast deep vs. superficial differences in modeling languages.
4. Recognize practical implications of trading expressive power for tractability.
5. Appreciate the fundamental role of a very small set of inter-related concepts.

### Teamwork and Communication Objectives
1. Develop and practice strong teamwork skills.
2. Develop and practice strong oral and written communication skills.
