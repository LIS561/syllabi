# Plagiarism and academic integrity

Plagiarism reported by me and confirmed by the department’s
investigation results in failing the assignment and possibly failing
the course. Since deadline stress tempts students to plagiarize,
please ask for an extension if you feel panicked and desperate.

This policy adheres to the University of Illinois academic integrity
policy, in Article 1, Part 4 of the University Student Code. All
written coursework in this course is expected to be your own, with all
words and/or ideas from other sources fairly attributed. To use
phrases and/or ideas from any other source as if they were your own
constitutes plagiarism. Submitting your own work for more than one
course without permission of both instructors can also constitute
plagiarism. The Code specifies that ignorance of these standards is
not an excuse. You can familiarize yourself with the code here:
www.admin.uiuc.edu/policy/code/, and with our library’s guidelines at
www.library.illinois.edu/learn/research/academicintegrity.html.
