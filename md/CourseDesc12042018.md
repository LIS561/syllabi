# Course Description

Information modeling is the application of formal syntaxes and
structures to create systems for recording, managing and accessing
information. Organizations need expertise in the fundamentals of
information management when adapting to new technological
environmentsand the increasing scale of data. This course emphasizes
the fundamental role of a very small set of inter-related concepts
from logic, set theory, and discrete mathematics. Specific methods
considered include requirements analysis, conceptual modeling, and
mapping between different models. Applications typically include XML
markup languages, relational database design, and logic-based
languages and reasoning systems using RDF and OWL. Communicating
orally and in writing and working in teams are also emphasized as they
are fundamental parts of information modeling work.
