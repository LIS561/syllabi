## Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: Run, hide or
fight.


### Run

Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.

- Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.
- Leave personal items behind.
- Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts
  yourself at risk.
- Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.

### Hide

When you can’t or don’t want to run, take shelter indoors.

- Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.
- If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.
- If someone is trying to hurt you and you can’t evacuate, get to a place
  where you can’t be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your
  phone, don’t make any noise and don’t come out until you receive an
  Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.

### Fight

As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of
survival.

- Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you
  can use to defend yourself.
- Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.
- Mentally prepare yourself – you may be in a fight for your life.

Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional
assistance in emergency situations.
