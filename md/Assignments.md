# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable). Completed, graded assignments may be repeated for an improved grade with no penalty other than 4.5/5 being the highest possible grade for repeated assignments. Further arrangements for makeup work will be made as needed.

**Assignments, Exercises & Grade Distribution:**

- Eleven graded assignments (due 1 hour before class meeting in the week they are due): 5 points each (55 points total).
- Eleven ungraded exercises (due 25 hours before class meeting in the week they are due): 2 points each for completion (22 points total).
- Four reading responses: 5 points each (20 points total).
- Attendance and participation in class and on forums: 3 points.

**Reading Responses**

Up to twenty points (5 points each) are available for 4 reading responses, posted to the class discussion forum. You may submit more than 4 reading responses; the best 4 will be counted. Please identify them in the subject line as a *reading response* together with a topic description. 

Canonical reading responses include:

(1) *Critical questions*: carefully worded
descriptions of an obstacle to understanding and applying concepts and
methods covered in the assigned readings. These need to be more than
a simple request for clarifying a term or idea. Each question should be
one to three paragraphs in length, and should include:

- A one sentence summary of the question (citing the location of the anomalous passage in the reading);
- A longer, lucid explanation of the question and the obstacle that it identifies;
- A justification for why the question is important;
- Some remarks on the context in which the question arose: how did you recognize that it was a problem?

(2) Lucid responses: carefully worded responses to a colleague's critical question. These should include:

A brief restatement of the question;
A brief summary of your approach -- this could resolve the problem or show it in a new light;
A longer, lucid explanation of your approach;
A justification for your approach.

We are open to other ways for you to engage with the reading and with your fellow classmates in the forums and we may discover other forms of reading response as we go.
