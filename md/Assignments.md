# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable). Comprehension quizzes may be
repeated up until the deadline.

### Comprehension quizzes

Comprehension quizzes are based on the reading assignments, and are
completed online. Their purpose is to help ensure that you
understand the concepts and methods presented by the authors of our
readings. A link to each quiz will be posted to the Moodle calendar.

### Reading responses and homework assignments

You will be assigned written exercises that are based on the required
readings. Like the comprehension quizzes, these assignments will help
you assess your understanding of the material you've read. Some of
these assignments will be reading responses: questions posed by the
instructors that require you to reflect more thoughtfully on what
you've read than exercises with right and wrong answers. Typical
reading responses are two to four paragraphs in length, and are graded
based on how thoughtfully and lucidly you have engaged with the
question.

### Group classroom exercises

Classroom exercises involve practice with the course content and its
application in information modeling scenarios. Engagement with the
problem at hand, cooperation with group members, and thoughtful spoken
and written treatment of issues that arise are the most important
factors in assessing your contributions in this setting, just as they
are in the working world. 

### Group Modeling Projects

You will be assigned to three groups and contribute to three analysis
and modeling projects over the course of the semester. Some of your
work on these case studies will take place during class, but you will
need to meet as a group outside of class to complete each step of each
project. Your instructors will provide detailed instructions for each
of the projects, but all three will require you to prepare an account
of the project domain in written natural language, abstractions in one
or more artificial languages, and one or more diagrams. Deliverables
for these projects will be staged, with three graded assignments per
project.


### Participation

Your participation grade is a combination of your attendance, in-class
participation, and overall progress throughout the semester; all
assessed by your instructor.

The following rubric will be used to assign a score:


10

:   Student has been an active participant in class discussion, bringing
    to the class insights from their interpretations of readings and
    lived experiences and is demonstrating an increasing grasp of the
    key concepts covered in class.

8

:   Student has been an active participant in some of the class
    discussion and is demonstrating some gains in grasping key
    concepts covered in class.

6

:   Student is occasionally active in class and is demonstrating some
    learning, but it is clear they are not performing to their full
    capabilities.

4

:   Student has missed several classes and/or is not always active when
    attending class.

0

:   Student has consistently missed class during the rated period.
