completed online. Their purpose is to help you ensure that you
understand the concepts and methods presented by the authors of our
readings. A link to each quiz will be posted to the Moodle calendar.

### Group classroom exercises

Classroom exercises involve practice with the course content and its
application in information modeling scenarios. Engagement with the
problem at hand, cooperation with group members, and thoughtful spoken
and written treatment of issues that arise are the most important
factors in assessing your contributions in this setting, just as they
are in the working world.
