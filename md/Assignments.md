# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable). Comprehension quizzes may be
repeated for an improved grade within one week of receiving the
initial grade.

**Comprehension quizzes**

Comprehension quizzes are based on the reading assignments, and are
completed online. Their purpose is to help you ensure that you
understand the concepts and methods presented by the authors of our
readings.  A link to each quiz will be posted to the Moodle calendar.

**Group classroom exercises**

Classroom exercises involve practice with the course content and its
application in information modeling scenarios. Engagement with the
problem at hand, cooperation with group members, and thoughtful spoken
and written treatment of issues that arise are the most important
factors in assessing your contributions in this setting, just as they
are in the working world. 

**Modeling Scenario Memoranda**

These are short written assignments (typically 1-2 pages) that are
connected to modeling exercises and the case studies that frame
them. The memos offer analyses and recommendations to (and request
clarifications from) a hypothetical audience of professional
colleagues, clients, or supervisors.

Assesment of your work on these exercises will be based on the clarity
of your writing and your success in presenting the appropriate tone.
