All assignments are required for all students. All work must be

### Comprehension quizzes

Comprehension quizzes are based on the reading assignments, and are
completed online. Their purpose is to help you ensure that you
understand the concepts and methods presented by the authors of our
readings. A link to each quiz will be posted to the Moodle calendar.

### Group classroom exercises

Classroom exercises involve practice with the course content and its
application in information modeling scenarios. Engagement with the
problem at hand, cooperation with group members, and thoughtful spoken
and written treatment of issues that arise are the most important
factors in assessing your contributions in this setting, just as they
are in the working world. 

### Modeling scenario memoranda

Modeling scenario memoranda are short written assignments (typically 1-2 pages).
In these memos, you will offer analyses and recommendations, and request
clarifications, related to modeling exercises and the case studies that frame
them. The audience for such memos generally includes professional colleagues, 
clients, and supervisors; you will practice writing for these audiences.

Assesment of your work on these exercises will be based on the clarity
of your writing and on your success in presenting the appropriate tone.

### Participation and engagement in class and on forums

Participation and engagement, both in class and on Moodle, means cooperating with group members;
asking and answering questions in class, online and in office hours; working consistently 
throughout the semester; and engaging with classmates both inside and outside of class.
