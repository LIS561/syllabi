# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable). Completed, graded assignments may be repeated for an improved grade with no penalty other than 4.5/5 being the highest possible grade for repeated assignments. Further arrangements for makeup work will be made as needed.
