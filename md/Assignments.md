# Assignments and Evaluation

All assignments are required for all students. All work must be
completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete assignments
will not be given full credit unless the student has contacted the
instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or in the case of
emergencies, as soon as practicable). Completed, graded assignments may be repeated for an improved grade with no penalty other than 4.5/5 being the highest possible grade for repeated assignments. Further arrangements for makeup work will be made as needed.

**Assignments, Exercises & Grade Distribution:**

- Eleven graded assignments (due 1 hour before class meeting in the week they are due): 5 points each (55 points total).
- Eleven ungraded exercises (due 25 hours before class meeting in the week they are due): 2 points each for completion (22 points total).
- Four reading responses: 5 points each (20 points total).
- Attendance and participation in class and on forums: 3 points.

**Reading Responses**

Up to twenty points are available for four critical questions
posted to the class discussion forum and identified in the subject
line as a *reading response* together with a topic description. Critical questions are carefully worded
descriptions of an obstacle to understanding and applying concepts and
methods covered in the assigned readings. These need to be more than
a simple request for clarifying a term or idea. Each question should be
one to three paragraphs in length, and should include:

- A one sentence summary of the question (citing the location of the anomalous passage in the reading);
- A longer, lucid explanation of the question and the obstacle that it identifies;
- A justification for why the question is important;
- Some remarks on the context in which the question arose: how did you recognize that it was a problem?
