# Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of information modeling methods
used in current information management applications. The specific methods
considered include relational database design, conceptual modeling,
and ontologies. The basic concepts underlying these
methods are sets, relations, entities, and
logics. Applications considered include relational database design
and RDF/OWL semantic web languages. Set theory and logic are emphasized as the
foundational frameworks for information modeling in general, and for
contemporary web-based information management and delivery systems
(including semantic web technologies) in particular.
