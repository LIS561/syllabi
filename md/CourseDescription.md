# Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of information modeling methods
used in current information management applications. The specific methods
considered include relational database design, conceptual modeling,
markup systems, and ontologies. The basic concepts underlying these
methods are, respectively, relations, entities, grammars, and
logic. Implementations include relational database design, FR/EER/UML
diagrams, XML markup languages, and RDF/OWL semantic web
languages. First order logic is emphasized throughout as the
foundational framework for information modeling in general, and for
contemporary web-based information management and delivery systems
(including semantic web technologies) in particular.
