## Sample Policy Text

All assignments are required for all students. Completing
all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must
be completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete
assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has
contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).
